        <h2>What is a generator?</h2>
        <p>
          Generators are declarative iterators that will be used more and more
          as Javascript matures. Why? Because, the comity behind Ecmascript is
          deciding to move more towards a declarative approach rather than an
          imperative approach to programming in Javascript.
        </p>

        <p>
          Okay, but what are those terms...iterators...declarative...imperative?
        </p>

        <p>
          Consider an array that you loop over using forEach() or a standard for
          loop, for instance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Iterators are data structures that you loop over using for loops and
          variations of for loops (e.g. the forEach() method).
        </p>

        <p>
          Declarative, means a type of programming where you tell the computer,
          "Do what I say, and you decide how it gets done".
        </p>

        <p>
          Imperative, means a type of programming where you tell the computer,
          "Do what I say, exactly as I tell you to".
        </p>

        <p>
          What this essentially means is that Javascript is going to have a
          larger library of code that programmers can use to make their lives
          easier. <em><strong>But</strong></em
          >, that ease of use will not have the same amount of power and freedom
          that comes with the more imperative way to program that is a bit more
          complex as well.
        </p>

        <h2>When Would I use generators?</h2>
        <p>
          You would use generators whenever you want to make your life easier by
          making your code easier to read and understand, when you are going
          over a data set like an array, set, map, or even objects ( they can be
          iterated over with custom code ).
        </p>
        <p>
          Generators would also be used whenever you want more control over the
          flow of the iteration of your data. This is because with Generators,
          you can pause and resume execution according to the conditions that
          you specify.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generators execute until they reach the yield keyword, and not
          necessarily the end of the length of a string or array, for example.
        </p>

        <h2>Examples of Generator Use</h2>

        <h3>Modular Generator Methods</h3>
        <p>
          Generators are recognized by the use of an asterisk next to either the
          function keyword, or next to the name of the function.
        </p>
        <p>
          My personal preference is to put the asterisk next to the name of the
          function, because whenever I invoke the function it will be easy to
          know if that function is a generator or not.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
          function *numberIterator( start = 5, end = 25, step = 5 ) {
            let iterations = 0;
            for ( let i = start; i < end; i += step ) {
              iterations++;
              yield i;
            }
            return iterations;
          }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          It's also a good idea to use destructuring for your parameters, so
          that it can be modular to use. Setting defaults are also not a bad
          idea, in regards to protecting yourself from logical errors (e.g.
          undefined values).
        </p>
        <p>
          The yield keyword is what makes a generator special. It is used here
          to indicate that the execution will stop after iterations++ in this
          example. This helps keep the code a bit simpler by for instance,
          allowing you to declare <em>yield i</em>, instead of having an if
          statement there.
        </p>

        <h3>Iterating over objects</h3>
        <p>
          Objects are not an iterable data structure, but that doesn't mean we
          can't iterate over it. Which also means, we can use Generators to
          iterate over objects.
        </p>
        <p>Here's an example:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            var properties = {
              name: "Sergio",
              hairColor: "black",
              eyeColor: "brown",
              *[Symbol.iterator]() {
                for( let i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
                  yield i;
                }
              }
            };

            for( let person of properties ) {
              console.log(person); //prints out [0, 1, 2, 3...29]
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          What we are doing is creating a properties object, which has a name,
          hairColor, eyeColor, and a Generator as a property (remember the
          asterisk!).
        </p>
        <p>
          Defining a generator within an object will then allow us to iterate
          over it using for loops; which is pretty awesome!
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, I decide to iterate over the object and log out its properties
          with a for...of loop.
        </p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          We learned that generators are a more declarative way to loop over our
          data, that generators provide a way to control when to pause and
          resume data iteration, and that Javascript is moving towards the
          declarative programming paradigm instead of an imperative paradigm.
