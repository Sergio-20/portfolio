        <p>
          Much like how callback functions are used to write code that executes
          in the background, while other code executes in the foreground,
          promises also accomplishes this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Promises were designed and developed in order to address the issues
          with callback functions when writing asynchronous code. Which, we will
          explore below.
        </p>
        <h2>Issues with Callbacks</h2>
        <p>
          While callbacks are great, and are still widely used today, they have
          many issues. These issues can be summarized in that they are too
          <u>unpredictable</u> and <u>error-laden</u>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many programmers become frustrated with callbacks due to how
          unpredictable the timing is. Sometimes the code is called too late,
          other times too early. Sometimes a customers credit card is charged
          once, other times more than once (uh oh!). Other times not at all
          (why!?).
        </p>
        <p>
          To add to the programmer's woes, the
          <a
            href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=callback+hell&iax=images&ia=images"

          >
          will only further your anxiety when dealing with unmaintained code. It
          will be full of errors, and/or extremely hard to make any sense of it.
          This will in turn, cause you and your team to spend more time than
          needed on correcting any problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          How then, can these issues be resolved, or at the very least be
          minimized?
        </p>
        <h2>Promises to the Rescue</h2>
        <p>
          All of those issues we previously mentioned about callbacks being
          unpredictable and buggy are solved by Promises.
        </p>
        <p>
          Promises are a way for us to write our code in a way that is easier to
          read, and can still be read top-to-bottom without our eyes jumping up
          and down the page due to callback functions's triangle of
          doom/callback hell.
        </p>
        <h3>An example of Promise Use</h3>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="../../img/code-samples/promises/example_01.PNG"
            alt="Code demonstrating the use of Promises."
          />

        </figure>
        <p>
          As you can see in the image above, they are read from top-to-bottom.
          Which is great for our eyes, and it also makes our code easier to
          understand.
        </p>
        <h4>How to use</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              First, as we see in the image above, first we create our Promise
              using the "new Promise" syntax since Promises are objects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, we type in our logic for what we want to happen if what we
              want to happen succeeds or fails.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Second, the result of that success or failure in step one, is then
              taken care of by our logic in the "then()" function.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Third, we take care of any errors that occur with the "catch()"
              function.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Fourth, is the optional step. We can then use the "finally()"
              function to ensure that whatever is within it, will always
              execute. It doesn't matter if there was an error or not, this code
              snippet will always execute at the end of our script.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          As fascinating as promises are, they are well worth investing more of
          your time in order to further comprehend them. They are fantastic for
          writing asynchronous code, which is why they are used so much in
          <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          They solve the unpredictable nature, and buggy mess that is callback
          function use.
        </p>
