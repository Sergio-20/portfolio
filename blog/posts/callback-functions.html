          A callback function is a function that is within another function. It
          gets executed at some later time, but not immediately (unlike how
          Javascript code is normally executed).
        </p>
        <p>
          The time at which it gets executed is either said specifically by the
          programmer, or is determined by interferences such as internet speed,
          large data processing, resource fetching, etc.
        </p>
        <h2>Asynchronous Programming</h2>
        <p>That's great and all, but who cares? When and why should I use them?</p>
        <p>
          What makes callback functions a staple of traditional Javascript programming 
          is that they are a built-in feature of the language. Code execution does not 
          stop and wait for the current function to finish its tasks before the program 
          then calls the next code down the script of the program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, functions and code which are not a callback function will continue 
          to get executed. Once that is finished (the stack clears), then the callback 
          functions will execute in the order they were first encountered.
        </p>
        <p>And that my friends, is what is known by the name of Asynchronous Programming.</p>
        <p>
          You should care since callback functions can potentially speed up your website or 
          application, because code execution does not stop and wait to finish its current 
          process before moving on.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should use callback functions whenever you need to get a resource (like images, text, audio), 
          or process some data, but where you also do not want your program to stop and wait for the entire
          process to complete. After all, you don't want to make the end user, a visitor to your website or app,
          to have to wait too long otherwise they will get bored and leave.
        </p>
        <h3>Examples</h2>
        <p><em>That cool and everything, but let me <strong>see some code!</strong></em></p>
        <p><em>Sounds good. Let me walk you through a couple of examples:</em></p>
        
        <h4>Example 1</h4>
        <figure>
          <img src="../../img/code-samples/callback-functions/example_01.PNG" alt="The set timeout function with a callback function within it." />
          <figcaption>setTimeout() with a callback function.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In this first example, the console.log() function is declared first and executes first. Just as we'd expect it to.</p>
        <p>
          However, an interesting thing happens...our code within the setTimeout() function executes 
          <em><strong>after</strong></em> our final console.log(), which prints out to the console: "This executes second!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, the code that is not a callback function is not asynchronous, 
          which means that code will execute immediately and will <em><strong>not</strong></em> be put
          on the backburner; unlike our callback functions.
        </p>
        <p>This is why our code within the setTimeout function executes last in this example.</p>
        <p>
          So, the execution order is: the first console.log() >>> 
          the last console.log() at the end of our script >>> and then our console.log()
          found within the setTimeout function.
        </p>

        <h4>Example 2</h4>
        <figure>
          <img src="../../img/code-samples/callback-functions/example_02.PNG" alt="An event listener, which has a callback function within it." />
          <figcaption>A callback function within the click event listener.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Our second example proceeds like so:</p>
        <p>The myBtn event listener get's put into the heap, where it waits to get called upon mouse click.</p>
        <p>This happens first.</p>
        <p>What happens next is our console.log() at the end of the script gets called and prints its message to the console.</p>
        <p>
          Lastly, our user finally clicks the button and console.log() prints, 
          "I execute after the console.log() outside the event listener!"
        </p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Ultimately, callback functions help us keep our code running 
          efficiently by not having our code stop and wait for the current 
          function execution to finish.
